# Dynamic Platformer

## Purpose of this project
This project is a simple 2D platformer with no twists (not yet). The goal of this project is to learn more about how to make a functional collision system within a 2D environment and how to use physics to ensure a smooth feel to the player when controlling the character. GameMaker Studio 2 does not have a built in rigid body system that would prevent entities from merging with each other when colliding, so I have been writing one myself.

# Features and Information

## Controls
- Control with WASD
- Shift to toggle running
- UP to jump
- Backspace restarts the game
- Enter stops time, but will consume time from your meter on the right

## Features
- Moving platforms to jump on and interact with
- Momentum system which will propel player even when not pressing the move button (things do not come to a stop instantly in real life, so why should they in my game? Answer, because I like challenging myself)
- Squishing the player restarts the game
- Some Animation (ain't great tho)
